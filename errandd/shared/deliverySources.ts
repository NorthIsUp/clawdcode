/**
 * Two-tier delivery-source identity space — the browser-safe core.
 *
 * This module is imported by the esbuild **web bundle** as well as the daemon,
 * so it MUST stay pure types + consts: no node/bun imports, no server code.
 *
 * Tier 1 — CORE sources: a closed, compile-time union derived from the static
 *   `CORE_DELIVERY_SOURCES` tuple. The four first-party providers
 *   (github / sentry / datadog / linear) live here and are known at build time,
 *   so `source === "github"` style narrowing keeps working across the codebase.
 *
 * Tier 2 — PLUGIN sources: an OPEN, branded-string identifier space. A
 *   `SourcePlugin` registered at runtime (see app/hooks/sources.ts) picks any
 *   id; it is validated then branded into `PluginDeliverySource`. Because the
 *   brand is erased at runtime, a plugin id is just a string on the wire — but
 *   the type system stops a bare `string` from silently standing in for a
 *   `DeliverySource` without going through {@link asDeliverySource}.
 *
 * DB/API reads must tolerate unknown historical/plugin source strings: use
 * {@link asDeliverySource} (a total, never-throwing coercion) rather than a
 * checked parse, so a historic row or a plugin-written row with an id outside
 * the core union never crashes a reader.

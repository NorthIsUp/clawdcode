 * `SourcePlugin` in the registry (`./sources`); `dispatchInbound` looks the
 * source up, builds its per-request `WebhookSpec`, and drives the shared
 * `handleSignedWebhook` lifecycle. There is ZERO per-provider branching here.
 *
 * `WebhookDeps` / `ReceiverResult` live here (the shared contract every source
 * and the server speak). The GitHub-specific `handleWebhook` / `dispatchHook` /
 * `getWebhookSecret` are re-exported from `./github` for back-compat with the
 * callers (server, sessions route, tests) that still import them by name.
